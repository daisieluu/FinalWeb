        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I am a passionate individual eager to grow in my field. I enjoy learning new skills and taking on
            challenging projects.</p>
        <p>With a strong background in finance and a keen interest in investment banking, I have honed my skills in
            analysis, negotiation, and strategic planning. My academic journey at Gonzaga University has equipped me
            with the knowledge and tools necessary to excel in the financial industry.</p>
        <p>Beyond academics, I have gained valuable experience working as a Welcome Desk Concierge at the Hemmingson
            Center and as a Consultant at Vela Academy. These roles have helped me develop excellent communication
            and problem-solving abilities, which are crucial in the fast-paced world of investment banking.</p>
        <p>In addition to my professional pursuits, I am an avid learner who constantly seeks opportunities to
            expand my horizons. Whether it's through attending industry conferences, participating in workshops, or
            engaging in online courses, I am committed to staying updated with the latest trends and developments in
            finance.</p>
        <p>My ultimate goal is to become a great investment banker, where I can leverage my skills and knowledge to
            make a positive impact on clients and the financial industry as a whole. I am excited about the future
            and look forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
